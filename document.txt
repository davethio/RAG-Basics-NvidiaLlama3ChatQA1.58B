Indonesia AI Day, an event organized by Indosat Ooredoo Hutchinson in Jakarta on November 14, 2024 revealed how empowerment initiatives were underway to resolve pressing human challenges and gave assurance as to how AI development bode well for Indonesia’s economy in the future. This groundbreaking project, launched during the AI Day event, is a significant step forward in advancing Indonesia’s digital sovereignty, preserving its linguistic heritage and unlocking new pathways for socio-economic growth and innovation. Sahabat-AI is a collective effort to empower Indonesia with a locally developed open-source LLM ecosystem. Created by Indonesians, for Indonesians, it aligns with the Golden Indonesia 2045 vision, supporting national leadership in technology and infrastructure. Due to its understanding of local context, Sahabat-AI will enable Indonesians to build AI-based services and applications in Bahasa Indonesia and various local languages, addressing a gap left by other global AI models.
